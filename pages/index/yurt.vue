        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          The yurt, a type of dwelling used by nomadic and semi-nomadic people, is one of the most recognizable symbols of nomadic life on
          the Central
          Asia steppe. Yurts come in different varieties, but most have generally the same structure.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          There are three main structural components of the yurt. First, the “kerege,” which is a “bearing structural element” that makes up
          the
          walls. Then, there are the “uyk,” which are poles that create a dome structure for the roof. Finally, there is the “shanyrak,” which
          is a
          round rim that holds together the top of the dome [1].

        </div>
        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          Despite its simplicity, the yurt is designed to be incredibly sturdy and resistant to the elements. Malibekuly writes, “...the
          shanyrak
          protects the yurt from pressure in the form of snow and rain because of its shape. The round, streamlined shape of a truncated
          cone provides
          protection from strong winds” [2]. From this description, it is clear that the yurt and its design are largely a result of the
          environment
          in which it exists. The overall dome-like form of the yurt is to fight against “strong winds,” and other major aspects of the
          design combat
          the precipitation of the steppe, including snow, rain.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          Perhaps the best evidence of the yurt as a function of its environment are the variations of yurts from place to place. On the
          Mongolian
          steppe, for instance, where the “climatic conditions vary with sultry, strong winds,” the yurts are “the type of a classical hut or
          polygonal log
          ail” [3]. This differs from mountainous, “rocky slopes” of much of Kyrgyzstan, where the yurts are usually “elongated and pointed”
          [4].
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          From the steppe to the mountains to the forest, Malibekuly demonstrates that the physical environment is perhaps the single most
          important
          factor guiding the differences between yurts across regions. Precipitation, wind, vegetation, topography, and latitude all have a
          profound
          influence on the yurt’s shape and structure. This is, perhaps, unsurprising. Nomadic people live away from settled populations, so
          they must
          rely on the yurt as a safe dwelling no matter the conditions. That means adapting to the geographic environment and designing the
          yurt to
          match the specific natural forces it will face.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          The yurt, however, is not simply a utilitarian object. The yurt is also a place of art and spiritual culture. According to Yelena
          Lichman,
          “In Kazakhs folk image of the world available to usual conscious, such external features of the surrounding world as the sky, the
          Sun, the
          stars and the steppe served as a model for the outer and inner space of yurt” [5]. This demonstrates that even the spiritual
          aspects of the
          yurt are connected to the land and the environment. The “surrounding world” is central to the image of the yurt in a religious and
          mythological sense, and the “steppe,” the physical biome of the yurt, is one of the most important pieces of the folk spiritual
          culture of the
          nomadic people who live within it.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          The yurt is defined and characterized by the physical landscape it exists within and the climatic conditions that it protects its
          inhabitants
          from. An essential part of Central Asian nomadic and semi-nomadic culture, the yurt is a dwelling place, but beyond that, it is a
          grounded
          symbol of identity amidst a constantly changing world.
