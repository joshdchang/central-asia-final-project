          Sulaiman-Too, also known as Sulaiman Mountain, is a religious pilgrimage site in Osh, Kyrgyzstan. Rising up out of the ground near
          the
          center of the city, Sulaiman-Too is a large limestone outcrop. The site has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, which
          describes it
          as “the most complete example of a sacred mountain anywhere in Central Asia, worshiped over several millennia” [1], an impressive
          stretch of
          time for a cultural artifact, perhaps only made possible by its relative permanence as a physical geographic feature.

        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          Sulaiman-Too is mostly visited by women, who come from all over Central to visit the site and to experience its perceived
          spiritual powers [3].
          Specifically, the mountain and its rocks are said to have many different healing properties. Once at the top, there are different
          spots
          on the mountain that have different properties with regards to different ailments [4]. One specific hole in the rock is used for
          “sticking a
          sore arm all the way in to remove pain,” there is a cave for “infertile women to enter in order to become able to conceive
          children,” and there is “a slide
          of polished rock said to cure back aches” [5]. Women often walk around the mountain, utilizing the different topographic and
          geologic
          features for their particular ailments [6], showing the power people ascribe directly to the physical
          geography
          of the mountain.
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          The mountain also has spiritual importance beyond its supposed healing abilities. Sulaiman-Too’s name comes from King Solomon, a
          prophet in
          the Qur’an who is said to have various connections to the shrine [7]. However, Sulaiman-Too had significance long
          before
          Islam moved into the region. Claudius Ptolemy, an intellectual and traveler from Alexandria Egypt who lived from around 100 to 170
          AD, wrote
          about the “Stone Tower,” in his works, which is believed by many to be Sulaiman-Too [8]. Zoroastrian petroglyphs have been found
          throughout
          the site as well [9], indicating a history of spiritual connection to the site across religions and thousands of years.

        <p class="py-4 text-2xl">
          The idea that a mountain, or any geographic feature, would have such persistent cachet might seem novel, but it is less surprising
          in the
          context of how large of a role physical geography plays in cultures across Central Asia and elsewhere. When the land has such a
          large impact
          on existence in other respects, it is not hard to understand how it might be perceived to have power in domains such as
          health and religion.
